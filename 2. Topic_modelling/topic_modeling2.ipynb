terrorist guerrilla activity salvador supposed cause uprising government would fall people would join aggressive force support people totally reacted way cronkite well one question brought wisdom policy right moment latin american feel president duarte control situation people risen last offensive guerrilla work therefore likely exacerbate situation american presence therefore sort promoting self fulfilling prophecy coming getting guerrilla people upset big brother intervention therefore losing game instead winning president well realize southern friend memory great colossus north forth government asked need training terrorist guerrilla activity asked materiel helicopter forth better interdicting supply line illicit weapon brought guerrilla provided team provided also help keep

nicaragua transfer arm salvador mean coming guerrilla base country cronkite said could extricate easily salvador required given point proceeding assume mean given point could possibly extricate even initial stage could extricate without severe loss face president well think planning extricate thing could see could brought guerrilla correct assessment internal disturbance well would case behest present government government longer going without invitation forcing upon simply leave many people extricated cronkite even duarte force begin lose whatever military materiel assistance give whatever training adviser give pledging fighting force president certainly see likelihood going fighting force see continued work field diplomacy neighboring country interested central america south america
